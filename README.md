Apprentice is a dark, low-contrast colorscheme for Vim based on the awesome [Sorcerer](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3299) by Jeet Sukumaran. You can read all about it in the  official repo where @romainl maintains it.

This is a fork for personal use that aims to keep neovim features accessible. These where branched out of the way in the main project as per [commit 39ecc54](https://github.com/romainl/Apprentice/commit/39ecc54396fc84b32554551774fc785a762e1859).
