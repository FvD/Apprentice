[Apprentice is a dark, low-contrast colorscheme for
Vim](https://github.com/romainl/Apprentice). You can read all about it in the
official repo where @romainl maintains it. After many color schemes this is the
one I seem to have settled on, and once a year I give other color schemes a
chance. So far the excercise only seems to strengthen my preference for
Apprentice.

But @romainl stopped supporting neovim, my vim of preference, so this is a fork
for personal use that aims to keep neovim features accessible. These where
branched out of the way in the main project as per [commit 39ecc54](https://github.com/romainl/Apprentice/commit/39ecc54396fc84b32554551774fc785a762e1859).
I have added all changes in the master branch that were made since by hand
(maybe not the most efficient way, but it gives me some basic understanding of
the way the color scheme is structured).

You are of course more than welcome to use it as well, and let me know if there
are any issues to fix or new patches that have not been added, but would make
your life easier.
